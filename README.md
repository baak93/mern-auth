# MERN Authentication System with Email Verification & Password Reset

This project is a complete authentication system built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It includes features such as:

- Email Verification
- Secure 6-digit OTP sent to the user's email
- Password Reset functionality
- JWT-based authentication
- Responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS

The system provides login, registration, and password reset forms with OTP input validation.

## üìö Purpose

This project was developed for **study purposes**, with the goal of deepening my knowledge of authentication workflows in full-stack applications.  
I followed along with the YouTube tutorial using an **active watching** approach ‚Äì attempting to implement functionalities before watching how it was done in the video.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Original Tutorial
